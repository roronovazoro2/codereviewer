# Deployment Guide for Render

This guide will help you deploy your Code Reviewer Flask application to Render.

## Prerequisites

1. A Render account (free tier available)
2. Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. A Gemini API key for the AI functionality

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your code is pushed to a Git repository with the following files:
- `render.yaml` (deployment configuration)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
- `build.sh` (build script)
- `run.py` (application entry point)

### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Sign up/Login to Render**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up or log in to your account

2. **Create a New Web Service**
   - Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Render dashboard, go to your service settings
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Render will automatically provide this for PostgreSQL
     - `SECRET_KEY`: Render will auto-generate this

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically build and deploy your application

### 3. Database Setup

The application will automatically:
- Create database tables on first run
- Run migrations if needed
- Use PostgreSQL provided by Render

### 4. Access Your Application

Once deployed, Render will provide you with a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your Render dashboard:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI code review functionality
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to "production" (handled by render.yaml)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Auto-generated by Render
- `DATABASE_URL`: Auto-provided by Render

## Troubleshooting

1. **Build Failures**: Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. **Database Issues**: Ensure migrations run properly
3. **API Errors**: Verify your Gemini API key is set correctly

## Free Tier Limitations

- Render free tier has cold starts (app may take time to wake up)
- Limited bandwidth and build minutes
- Consider upgrading for production use

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render's documentation
2. Review build and runtime logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
